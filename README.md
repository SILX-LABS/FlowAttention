‚ö†Ô∏è Early Experimental Work  
This research is part of the Quasar project ‚Äî our ongoing search for better architectures for language modeling.  
It has not been tested on large-scale clusters or production workloads.  
These are early-stage experiments intended to explore new frontiers in attention design.

## Overview

Flow Attention introduces a new attention mechanism that removes the traditional Query-Key-Value formulation entirely.  
This architecture focuses on learned flow dynamics to propagate context bidirectionally across sequences with O(n) complexity, while preserving rich contextual reasoning capabilities.

Unlike standard Multi-Head Attention which relies on expensive O(n¬≤) pairwise token interactions, Flow Attention enables linear time and memory complexity, continuous information flow between tokens, and position-aware integration without attention matrices.

## Architecture

Flow Attention eliminates the quadratic attention matrix and replaces it with a continuous bidirectional flow mechanism.  
Instead of computing dense pairwise interactions between every token, it learns how information should flow through the sequence in both directions.  
Each token contributes to the evolving context, which is updated step by step with position-aware integration.  
This design achieves linear complexity while retaining the ability to model long-range dependencies.

## Project Goals

Break free from the quadratic cost of attention.  
Preserve contextual reasoning in language models.  
Provide a scalable path to massive models on limited compute.
