🧪 Disclaimer

⚠️ Early Experimental Work  
This research is part of the Quasar project — our ongoing search for better architectures for language modeling.  
It has not been tested on large-scale clusters or production workloads.  
These are early-stage experiments intended to explore new frontiers in attention design.

## Overview

Flow Attention introduces a new attention mechanism that removes the traditional Query-Key-Value formulation entirely.  
This architecture focuses on learned flow dynamics to propagate context bidirectionally across sequences with O(n) complexity, while preserving rich contextual reasoning capabilities.

Unlike standard Multi-Head Attention which relies on expensive O(n²) pairwise token interactions, Flow Attention enables linear time and memory complexity, continuous information flow between tokens, and position-aware integration without attention matrices.

## Architecture

Given a sequence of tokens:
\[
X = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n],\quad H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}
\]

Traditional MHA computes an attention matrix:
\[
A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}
\]
requiring O(n²) operations.

Flow Attention replaces this with a bidirectional flow operator, enabling contribution learning to determine how each token influences the global context, bidirectional flow propagation to move context forward and backward efficiently, and position-aware integration to inject structure without explicit pairwise attention.  
This design makes Flow Attention a drop-in replacement for MHA layers in existing architectures.

## Project Goals

Break free from the quadratic cost of attention.  
Preserve contextual reasoning in language models.  
Provide a scalable path to massive models on limited compute.
